# DavesPizzaPlace

## Project developed for Web Development module of NCI Software Development HND course.

### Project Brief
There is a new pizza company in town. You have been contracted to design the order page for their new website. When ordering online, the customer should provide:
    • Username and password (password must be 7 characters in length)
    • The size of the pizza they would like: Large, Extra-Large, Supersize (drop down list)
    • The number of pizza’s they want (must be numeric)
    • Discount Code

The pizza’s cost: Large=5 euro, Extra-Large=7 Euro, Supersize=17 Euro!
The order form will tell the customer how much their bill is.
This month’s discount code is ‘extracheese’. The customer gets a whopping 10% off their order if they type in this code!!
Provide appropriate error messages for validation.
For health and safety reasons, the customer should be given a warning if they select ‘Supersize’. This should happen as soon as they select this option. If possible a JQuery effect should get the customers attention.
